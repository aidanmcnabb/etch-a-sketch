/*
 this will be the file where the menu bar, timer, fire-o-meter and the stick man animation is stored.
 the menubar will include settings, reset game, rewatch intro, rewatch tutorial, audio settings, 

 be able to choose your drawing color

 im thinking that there needs to be a local storage parameter or a variable that if 'true', means the intro/tutorial has already been played and therefore you need to actively choose to watch/play again if you desire to

 with each completed card without mistakes, the hot-o-meter will go up and certain screen effects will begin to occur

 if i can figure this out, I would like to have a 'resume where you left off?' pop up after making progress in a game and closing the tab
